# 📘 pdf\_re\_AI\_der

**Under development since April 21st – Open for Collaboration**

A modern PDF reader powered by **AI** with deep integration of **LLMs**, **OCR**, and **contextual querying**. This isn’t just another summarizer—**it's an intelligent assistant** for navigating, understanding, and interacting with complex documents.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS
* **Backend:** Firebase, REST API
* **AI Integration:** LLM APIs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* **Document Handling:** PDF.js, OCR (for handwritten text recognition)

---

## 🔍 Core Features

1. **In-place Questioning:**
   Ask about any specific line in your PDF **without leaving the current page**.

2. **Handwriting Recognition Training:**
   Train the system on a few lines of your handwriting so you don't need to retype for future queries.

3. **Draw-to-Query Functionality:**
   Highlight or draw around a part of your document, and query the AI for explanations.

4. **Interaction Logging & Vector Storage:**
   Save all interactions with the LLM into vector chunks for **future context-aware retrieval**.

5. **Smart File Organization:**
   Categorize PDFs by course name, degree program, or other custom tags.
