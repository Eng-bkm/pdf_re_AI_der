This is a modern pdf reader with AI integration. Unlike most applications, it wont be used not just for summary generation, but contextualized querying too. It is integrated with OCR plus LLMS for hand writing recognition. This is a web based application which is open to scalability to other front ends.
Here you can:
1, ask about a specific line in your pdf withut leaving your page
2, you can teach the algorithm to the specific handwriting with a few lines of text( so that yu dont have to type every time you want to search about it)
3, query llms with just a drawing on the specific text you want more clarifications for
4, save all lllm interaction in a vector chunk for later use
5, catergorize pdf files, forexacmple, by course name, degree name, etc...
